# ParticleSimulation
Spherical particle simulation with different laws of physics.

Modes it currently has are:
- **Particle Life (inspired by CodeParade's same named video):** Generates random particle types with random attraction or repulsions to other particles, and generates specified amount of particles in a space. Assigns random particle types to said particles.
- **Newton's gravity law:** Generates random particle types with random masses & radiuses, generates specified amount of particles in a space. Assigns random particle types to said particles.

Almost anything is configurable so you can create the environment you want.
Currently in WIP.
